# devGCN

These computer based information systems are designed to help nurses provide better patient care. A good devGCN can perform a number of functions and deliver benefits such as improving staff schedules, accurate patient charting and improve clinical data integration.
The nursing department can have a better managed work force through schedule applications enabling managers to handle absences and overtime. The solution can also be used to monitor staffing levels and achieve more cost-effective staffing. Patient charting applications allow users to enter details regarding patients’ vital signs. Nurses also use it for admission information, care plan and all relevant nursing notes. All important data is securely stored and can be retrieved when required. Clinical data integration is also very useful, allowing nurses to collect, retrieve and analyze the clinical information and then integrate it to design a patients’ care plan.
All these features in devGCN ultimately lead to a reduction in planning time and better assessments and evaluations. The chance of prescribing the wrong medication also decreases since there is always a reference for electronically prescribed drugs.
